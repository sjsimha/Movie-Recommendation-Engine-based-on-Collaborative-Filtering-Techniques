# üé¨ Movie-Recommendation-Engine-based-on-Collaborative-Filtering-Techniques
In today‚Äôs internet-propelled world and the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence, it is a common expectation that the systems we interact with are smart enough to ‚Äúknow‚Äù what we want, perhaps better than even ourselves. Recommendations are now considered table-stakes in most eCommerce and other systems. Approximately 80% of the content watched on Netflix is discovered through its personalized recommendations, highlighting the system's effectiveness in guiding viewer choices. 

A movie recommendation engine helps users discover films tailored to their tastes by analyzing past preferences and similarities with other users. It enhances user experience, drives engagement, and reduces decision fatigue by delivering personalized, relevant suggestions in real time.

## üìå Project Overview
This project designs and implements a movie recommendation engine from scratch for the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) 100k real-life dataset, using collaborative filtering recommendation techniques for both **User-based** and **Item-based** methods, and adds a hybridization algorithm to combine results from the two independent recommenders into a singular output. It focuses on addressing the core challenges faced by such systems such as:

- **High data sparsity**
- **Cold start** problems
- **Scalability** constraints

## üß† Key Features

- **User-based collaborative filtering** using Pearson Correlation
- **Item-based collaborative filtering** using Cosine Similarity
- **Hybridization engine** using a weighted average approach
- **Na√Øve clustering** to improve scalability (using **K-means** clustering)
- **Discount factor** applied to similarity calculations for better reliability
- **MovieLens 100k** dataset for experimentation and validation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

- **Offline Phase**: Clustering + similarity computation
- **Online Phase**: Real-time rating prediction using precomputed values
- **Hybrid Engine**: Combines predictions from user and item recommenders

## üìä Evaluation Plan
Evaluation criteria for recommendation systems tend to be multi-faceted, with no single criterion capturing the essence of all system goals.
- Ratings Accuracy and the impact of Clustering on performance and accuracy will be the main evaluation metrics. 
- Standard training, tuning and evaluation practices based on emperical methods common in Machine Learning are employed.
