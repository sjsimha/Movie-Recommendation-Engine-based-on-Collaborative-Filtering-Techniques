# üé¨ Movie-Recommendation-Engine-based-on-Collaborative-Filtering-Techniques
In today‚Äôs internet-propelled world and the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence, it is a common expectation that the systems we interact with are smart enough to ‚Äúknow‚Äù what we want, perhaps better than even ourselves. Recommendations are now considered table-stakes in most eCommerce and other systems. In the modern internet driven ecosystem, businesses rely on recommendation systems to improve user interaction, enhance shopping potential and deliver personalized content. They help users discover items and content that they may otherwise not have known existed. Personalized recommendations are now a necessity for businesses to distinguish from other competitors in many industries such as Video-on-Demand, eCommerce, social media, etc. where they can significantly boost revenue generation.

A hybrid collaborative filtering-based movie recommender system, built from scratch using Python, to explore improvements in rating prediction accuracy, performance scalability, and data sparsity mitigation.

## üìå Project Overview

This project designs and implements a movie recommendation engine from scratch for the MovieLens 100k real-life dataset, using collaborative filtering recommendation techniques for both **User-based** and **Item-based** methods, and adds a hybridization algorithm to combine results from two independent recommenders into a singular output. It focuses on addressing the core challenges faced by such systems such as:

- **High data sparsity**
- **Cold start** problems
- **Scalability** constraints
